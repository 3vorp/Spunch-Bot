# ignore this branch it's just up for archival purposes

## it was used for the spunch bot rewrite into the normal discord command system from my weird custom command handler

## but there were a ton of merge conflicts I didn't want to bother fixing (since I started it at the same time as I was developing the old system)

## so I ended up literally just dragging files in and committing it instead

## but to keep the commit history making sense I'll leave this up
