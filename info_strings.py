while initially planned as a json, a lot of parsing ended up being required
so a second file ended up working far better for generating variables

I needed a way that would accommodate all formats I'd be parsing the text as
this resulted in the actual strings going into `help_categorized`
it's hard to parse and harder to read, sorted as
```
command category:
    command name:
        tuple of aliases,
        short description,
        syntax/example/notes
```

with two layers of nesting

it's also hard to iterate over or do anything meaningful with
so I generated `help_list` from the contents
it essentially fully removes the dictionary aspect making it a basic 2d list
```
command name:
    tuple of aliases
    short description,
    syntax/example/notes
```

this is still sorted via index rather than via key though
so if you want a specific description from a command etc there's no way
`help_dict` is generated because of this, for use in slash command descriptions etc
it's pretty easy to read through and parse:
```
main command name: short description
```

finally, the reason why command categories were necessary to have in `help_categorized`
`help_string` contains a formatted version of every command with description and categorized
meaning that the commands would need some form of category system to have stuff in the right place

prior to me using this system I'd have to write down everything twice
but now it's procedurally generated from the contents of `help_categorized`

by default the first available channel is set as the announcement one
the channel the command is sent in will become the new one when used
adding `none` will turn announcements for the server off
`reset` will bring it back to the first available one

**NOTES:**

to omit a portion (e.g. if you don't want to add a description), just leave that entry in the list blank or a space

**keep the semicolons for ordering purposes, just leave the area between them blank**
```
{PREFIX}embed title;; #00ff00; no description will be loaded
```
you can do this multiple times in a row as well:
```
{PREFIX}embed now it will just use the default yellow color;;; footer
```
you can also omit stuff at the end completely if you don't want a footer/color/images/description
```
{PREFIX}embed example title; no footer/image necessary
```
if the first argument is a url (starts with https:// or http://), it will try and find an image with that url
it will give a nonloading image if the url doesn't point to an image, since that's how I made the bot

IMPORTANT WARNING: Check the README.md more closely:

There are two possible reasons for this error appearing:

1. You didn't add a database. Copy the `database_example.json` file and rename it to `database.json`.

2. You are using the Code Runner Visual Studio Code extension. Check the bottom of README.md for a code snippet to paste that will fix this issue.

The bot will mostly work without a database, however commands such as `prefix` and `nut` will result in a LOT of errors.
